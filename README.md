The R files are labeled in parts so you can do them in order to generate the map we have. All the data we have used is uploaded here as well. If anything doesn't work feel free to reach out to us. 
You will have to download R and R studio if you don't have them downloaded already. The R scripts will walk you through any additional packages that need to be downloaded in R Studio.
